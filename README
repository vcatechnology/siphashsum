The siphashsum project is a suite of command line utilities for the SipHash [1]
hashing algorithms designed by Jean-Pilippe Aumasson
<jeanphilippe.aumasson@gmail.com> and Daniel J. Bernsteind <jb@cr.yp.to>.

The algorithm itself is implemented by siphash.h [2], a header-based
implementation of SipHash created by William Ahern
<william@25thandClement.com>, released under the CC0 Public Domain Dedication.
